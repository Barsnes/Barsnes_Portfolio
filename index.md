about_title: Who I am
---
I am a 17 year old boy from Norway, that loves doing photography, design and
coding! Photoshop and Illustrator are my strongest assets, but when I have the
camera at hand, I like to take photographs. Currently I am staying one year in the US, but in Norway I am studying Medium and Communication. I have a passion for great design, and will alway try to do my best!
