title: Using Netlify and Jekyll to build a website
---
Some months ago I looked into creating a blog. So, as most people would tell you to do, use Wordpress, well I did not want to do that. I had been using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host a [test site](https://findingfutures.eu) I created with my friend. We were really happy with how their services worked, but wanted to be able to change things in a simple dashboard, and not having to code everything, bit by bit. The answer was right in front of us, Jekyll and Netlify CMS. You can find the finished code in [this github repo](https://github.com/Barsnes/fox_eternity), and contact me if you have any further questions.



## What can you do with Jekyll and Netlify CMS?

Well, good question, it's actually a quite simple one to answer. Jekyll is a static site builder, meaning that it will take different files, typically markdown or html, and put them together in one html file. This is useful for a single, or multi-page website, such as a blog or a portfolio. Using this with Netlify CMS (Content Management System), will make it easy to push any type of content to your website. It is kind of like baking a cake, you need 



To start of, you have to install Jekyll, I will try to talk you though it, as simple as possible, but you can also go to their [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), if there is any confusion. I will cover the installation for Jekyll here.

## Using RubyInstaller

Start of by downloading [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/), which will download all the needed files to be able to run Jekyll.
